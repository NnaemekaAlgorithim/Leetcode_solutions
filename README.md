# MY LEETCODE SOLUTIONS

I created this repo to properly ducument my leetcode solutions with explanations that are as personal to me as possible, so that i could always come back here for reference to any problem i may have previously solved. I will be working mainly in python.

  * [Two-Sum](./Two-Sum): Uses Dictonary in python to optimize the code.
* **2. Add-Two-Numbers**
